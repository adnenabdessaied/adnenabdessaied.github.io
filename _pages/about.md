I am a third-year PhD Student the University of Stuttgart, Germany advised by [Prof. Andreas Bulling](https://perceptualui.org/people/bulling/). My research focuses broadly on multi-modal deep models at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Specifically, I develop novel AI model especially geared towards conversational tasks such as visual and video dialog. Furthermore, I research efficient mechanisms of marrying graph neural networks with large multi-modal transformers. Finally, I develop pre-training strategies of multi-modal foundation models specifically geared towards improving the downstream visual/video conversational tasks.
I hold a BSc and a MSc degrees in the elite study program Simulation Technology at the University of Stuttgart. The latter was **awarded with distinction** and received the [outstanding work award](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/press/IC-SimTech-honors-outstanding-theses-00001/) from the Industrial Consortium SimTech (IC SimTech).
