I am an AI Researcher at Aleph Alpha Research. 
Before that, I did a PhD at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, where I broadly focused on multi-modal deep models at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Specifically, I developed novel AI models especially geared towards conversational tasks such as visual and video dialog.
I hold a BSc and a MSc degrees in the elite study program Simulation Technology at the University of Stuttgart. The latter was **awarded with distinction** and received the [outstanding work award](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/press/IC-SimTech-honors-outstanding-theses-00001/) from the Industrial Consortium SimTech (IC SimTech).
